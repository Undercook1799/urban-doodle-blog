    <h1 class="header">Why HTML+CSS?</h1>
    <p class="reason">The answer is quite simple, websites need HTML to function and CSS to customize the theme of it. Learning HTML is ok - its all about tags. The CSS part is quite fun to be honest as its the customizing part of websites. The two colors I chose for this website is mainly red and black because I think it looks great. Creating new designs to see what is good or not; it is crazy awesome. I like it. I started learning about HTML + CSS about two days before this article is published. The progress that I made is wooohoooo. I hope to continue this website and eventually built up my resume.</p>
